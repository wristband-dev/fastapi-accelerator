2. Download and install the appropriate version for your OS
3. Verify the installation by opening a terminal or command prompt and running:
```bash
poetry --version # Should show v18.x.x or higher
```

### Terraform
Terraform is used to manage the GCP infrastructure as code if you are intending on using firebase for documenent storeage.
1. Visit [Terraform Install](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli) 
2. Download and install the latest 
3. Verify the installation by opening a terminal or command prompt and running:
```bash
terraform --version # Should show Terraform vx.x.x
```

### Google Cloud
GCP is used for firebase integration for the purposes of document storage
1. Visit [gcloud sdk install](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) 
2. Download and install the latest 
3. Verify the installation by opening a terminal or command prompt and running:

## Getting Started

You can start up the demo application in a few simple steps.

### 1) Sign up for a Wristband account

First, make sure you sign up for a Wristband account at [https://wristband.dev](https://wristband.dev).

### 2) Provision the FastAPI demo application in the Wristband Dashboard

After your Wristband account is set up, log in to the Wristband dashboard.  Once you land on the home page of the dashboard, click the button labelled "Add Demo App".  Make sure you choose the following options:

- Step 1: Subject to Authenticate - Humans
- Step 2: Application Framework - FastAPI (Python)

You can also follow the [Demo App Guide](https://docs.wristband.dev/docs/setting-up-a-demo-app) for more information.

### 3) Apply your Wristband configuration values

After completing demo app creation, you will be prompted with values that you should use to create environment variables for the FastAPI server. You should see:
```
APPLICATION_VANITY_DOMAIN=
CLIENT_ID=
CLIENT_SECRET=
``````
Copy those values, then create an environment variable file for the FastAPI server at: `backend/.env`. Once created, paste the copied values into this file.

### 4) Install dependencies

From the root directory of this project, you can install all required dependencies for both the frontend and backend with a single command:

```bash
npm run setup
```

### 5) Run the application

While still in the root directory, you can start the demo application with:

```bash
npm start
```

## Deployment

This repository is set up to use terraform to deploy on google cloud platform for hosting of the fast api as well as using firebase for the datastore.

### Update Project Configuration

Before deploying, you need to configure the Terraform variables with your specific GCP project details:

1. **Edit the configuration file**: Open `infrastructure/config.tfvars` and update the following values:

   ```bash
   project_id          = "your-gcp-project-id"
   app_name            = "your-app-name"
   billing_account_id  = "your-billing-account-id"
   region              = "us-central1"
   firestore_location  = "us-central"
   api_name            = "api"
   api_repo_name       = "api-repo"
   ```

2. **Required updates**:
   - `project_id`: Your GCP project ID (find this in the GCP Console or run `gcloud config get-value project`)
   - `app_name`: A unique name for your application (used in resource naming)
   - `billing_account_id`: Your GCP billing account ID (find this in the GCP Console under Billing)

3. **Optional updates**:
   - `region`: The GCP region where resources will be deployed (default: `us-central1`)
   - `firestore_location`: The location for your Firestore database (default: `us-central`)
   - `api_name` and `api_repo_name`: Names for the API components (can be left as defaults)

> **Note**: Make sure your GCP project has billing enabled before proceeding with deployment.

### Apply Infrastructure

```bash
cd infrastructure
./terraform.sh init
./terraform.sh plan
./terraform.sh apply -auto-approve
```

### Collect Service Accounts
This will collect the services accounts for `cloud run` and `firebase` which are used locally and for deployment and place them in the `backend/service_accounts` folder
```bash
cd infrastructure
./export_firebase_key.sh
./export_cloud_run_key.sh
```
